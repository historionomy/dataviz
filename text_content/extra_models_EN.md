# Links Between Historionomy and Other Theories in the Humanities

Historionomic data and models align well with other models developed in the humanities, which complement and strengthen the theory.

The complementary theories already identified are as follows:

* Emmanuel Todd's family models theory
* Bruce Bueno de Mesquita's selectorate theory
* Strauss and Howe's generational cycles theory

## The Family Models Theory

The website <a href="https://www.herodote.net/Introduction-synthese-1997.php">Herodote.net</a> offers a series of interviews with Emmanuel Todd, accompanied by explanatory texts that provide a good general introduction to anthropological thought.

The articulation of Emmanuel Todd's family models theory can be summarized in the attached infographic:

## The Selectorate Theory

The relationship between selectorate theory and historionomy is studied in detail in <a href="https://historionomie.fandom.com/fr/wiki/Historionomie_et_th%C3%A9orie_du_s%C3%A9lectorat">this article</a> on the historionomic wiki.

## The Generational Cycles Theory

Strauss and Howe's generational cycles theory can be summarized in the infographic below:

Finally, an example of the effect of the Strauss-Howe cycle in the real world would be the ebb and flow of the Welfare State:
