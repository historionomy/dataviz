# An Anthropological Approach to the Nation-State Journey

This article proposes a simplified schematic view of the nation-state journey from an anthropological perspective.

## The Archaic Sequence

The archaic sequence, which describes the establishment of the anthropological foundations of a human settlement area, is summarized in this infographic:

### The Primitive Stage

The spontaneous size of primitive human societies is limited by:

* Dunbar's "number," that is, the maximum number of personal social relationships a human can maintain at the same time (experimentally between 100 and 200 people)
* the technical capacities of transportation and communication
* The spontaneous size is therefore roughly the size of a village, tribe, or camp.

### Social Stratification

The densification of the population allows for the beginning of labor specialization, which increases the productivity of the society and the surplus that can be captured by elites. Social stratification takes place, and "chiefs" appear. Societies are at the "chiefdom" stage.

*Observable markers:*

* aristocratic tombs (tumuli, necropolises, etc.)

### The Networking of Chiefdoms

Social stratification and the elite's capture of wealth provide them with the means to contact neighboring tribes. The elites of tribes at Dunbar's number scale can then build their own elite networks.

*Observable markers:*

* beginning of cultural homogenization (common religion and mythology)
* circulation of prestige objects over long distances

## The Feudal Sequence

The feudal sequence, which describes the establishment of a feudal society, is summarized in this infographic:

### The Emergence of the Suzerain

Just as with small-scale "Dunbar circles," supreme chiefs appear within the network of chiefs. Social pyramids of chiefs or aristocrats, who each personally know one another, are established. Information circulates from one "Dunbar circle" to another. The suzerain becomes the chief of chiefs, with his main purpose being unity of command in case of war.

*Observable markers:*

* appearance of a "kingdom" and a special title for the suzerain, particularly war leader

### The Emergence of Parliaments and Administration

The suzerain has a superior capacity for capturing economic surpluses. He uses this capacity to build an "administration," i.e., a social group directly attached to him, which is literate (which has a significant cost) because it is tasked with circulating information across a large number of "Dunbar circles" through writing.

The reduction of social violence thanks to the suzerain’s authority increases the productivity and wealth of society. A bourgeois class emerges, structuring itself into assemblies. The suzerain allies with these assemblies:

* to build his administration
* to counter the authority of the great feudal lords

*Observable markers:*

* economic growth
* unification of law
* emergence of bourgeois assemblies
* autonomy of cities
* (re)appearance of massive coinage

### The Peak of Feudal Power

The beginning of administration and centralization gives the suzerain considerable power. The suzerain uses this new power to conquer new territories and enters into conflicts with neighboring countries.

*Observable markers:*

* increased military activity
* (re)appearance of large-scale mercenaries, as the suzerain becomes capable of regularly paying his troops with fiduciary currency

### Civil Wars

Central power is still very fragile, as it largely relies on personal ties. External military adventures deplete the suzerain's financial resources. As soon as a central power representative has a weak personality, major unrest arises.

*Observable markers:*

* civil wars (succession, religious, etc.)

## The Absolutist Sequence

The absolutist sequence, which describes the establishment of an absolutist society, is summarized in this infographic:

### Absolutization

The central power benefits from its special status as suzerain and its alliance with the rising bourgeoisie to stabilize the situation. After purging the excesses of military adventures, administrative construction resumes. Despite resistance, the great feudal lords, the feudal aristocracy, are incorporated into the administration. Power becomes less personal and more imminent.

*Observable markers:*

* stabilization of the capital
* increase in central regulatory production
* standing army
* permanent taxes
* increase in secular art compared to sacred art
* subordination of religion
* construction of military roads

### Absolutist Imperialism

After bringing all the great feudal lords to heel, the central power possesses unprecedented economic means. It uses these means once again for an imperialist and expansionist policy.

*Observable markers:*

* multiplication of wars of aggression
* beginning of colonialism
* professionalization of military leadership

### The Ancien Régime

The central power reaches the physical limits of its expansion potential, until finances are exhausted. The old military aristocracy loses its legitimacy, which rested on victorious wars. The new robe aristocracy, stemming from the bourgeoisie that joined the administration, then turns to "intensive" investment in the national territory to increase its power, triggering strong economic growth and the start of mass literacy.

*Observable markers:*

* economic growth
* cultural unification, increased literary production, expansion of the national language's use among local small elites
* increase in literacy
* construction of trade routes

### The National Revolution

The side effects of economic growth (cultural unification, literacy, and/or urbanization) lead to the emergence of new elites and the ideological activation of the masses. As soon as the central power loses both its legitimacy (via humiliation, for example, military) and its financial capacity (inevitably due to the arms race triggered by economic growth, making the fiscal system obsolete), the national revolution begins.

The final result of the national revolution is the establishment of a mass trust society:

* literacy enables exchanges beyond the Dunbar circle
* the purge of the most radical elements during the National Revolution calms the masses’ impulses
* cultural unification allows citizens to be considered as members of one’s extended family
