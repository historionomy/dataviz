# Introduction to Historionomy

Historionomy is an emerging science that searches for deep patterns and dynamics in history—institutional, event-driven, and anthropological—whose study enables the anticipation of the world's future developments.

## Historionomic Models

Historionomy has already identified three major recurring historical models:

* The cycle of political divide
* The journey of nation-states
* The ABCDE civilizational scheme

### The Cycle of Political Divide

Every human society is organized according to a left/right divide of an __anthropological__ nature:

* The *far-left*, about 1/6 of the civic body, consists of people who were not part of the civic body when the institutions governing the current social contract were established. These people have an interest in radically overturning the institutions to establish a __new__ social contract more in their favor.
* The *left*, about 1/3 of the civic body, consists of people included in the current social contract, who have an interest in evolving it.
* The *right*, about 1/3 of the civic body, consists of people included in the current social contract, who have an interest in maintaining it as is.
* The *far-right*, about 1/6 of the civic body, consists of people who were favored during the __previous version__ of the social contract and whose situation has worsened under its current version. These people have an interest in radically overturning the institutions to return to the __previous__ social contract.

The dynamic of the political divide is marked by the more or less regular entry of new people into the civic body over time, who are disadvantaged because they were not considered in the current social contract.

These people then group on the far-left, developing new radical ideologies that might carry their demands. Over time, these new ideas are gradually integrated into the social contract through political compromises and generational changes.

Members of the far-left gradually shift toward the left, the left toward the right, the right toward the far-right, and the far-right disappears. Political ideologies follow the same movement.

### The Journey of Nation-States

A detailed examination of social dynamics in many states or nations over time reveals that political dynamics within a country generally follow the same steps at a similar pace, along a journey whose minimal observed duration is around 600 years, although it can be slowed or even halted by external interventions.

#### The Standard Journey

The following table summarizes these steps, providing the most "standard" example, that of modern England:

| Date | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| t = 0 | A "confederation" is established with a "suzerain" as the central authority. | Between 1066 and 1087, William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, conquers the territory of modern England, establishing a new centralized rule. |
| From t = 0 to t+150 years | The "suzerain" gradually consolidates power over the oligarchs. During this period, the country experiences increasing prosperity due to the securing of territory. New, smaller elites emerge across the country. | |
| Around t+200 years | The suzerain begins creating a unified judicial system that supersedes the oligarchs' local authorities. The smaller elites start organizing, and the suzerain often forms alliances with them. | In 1295, King Edward I establishes the Model Parliament. |
| Around t+200 / t+250 years | Thanks to alliances with the smaller elites and two centuries of growing authority, the suzerain's power reaches its first peak. The suzerain, slowly becoming a "sovereign," applies this new power to military expeditions outside the kingdom. | In 1337, King Edward III initiates the Hundred Years' War against France. |
| Around t+250 / t+300 | Foreign military campaigns continue until the kingdom becomes exhausted and the sovereign weakens. The oligarchs exploit this weakness to incite unrest, seeking to regain authority, leading to civil wars. | Example: After winning significant victories and waging war for over a century, England is finally expelled from France, leading to the start of the Wars of the Roses. |

If the sovereign is strong enough, typically the case for large states, they eventually succeed in reasserting control over the oligarchs.

| Date | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| From t+300 to t+450 | The sovereign consolidates their authority over the kingdom by establishing a centralized administration composed of the emerging smaller elites, helping to control the oligarchs. Many oligarchic revolts may occur during this period, but they are ultimately suppressed. | The Tudor dynasty begins consolidating absolute power in England. |
| From t+450 to t+600 | The sovereign reaches absolute power within. The kingdom becomes increasingly centralized, both administratively and culturally. The sovereign uses this new power to wage imperialist wars against neighboring states. | Elizabeth I and the later Stuart sovereigns consolidate absolute power over England and initiate the first English colonial empire. |
| Around t+600 | The sovereign wages wars until the kingdom reaches economic exhaustion. Conquests cease, and the absolutist elite gradually loses legitimacy. Cultural unification allows the smaller elites to achieve an unprecedented level of solidarity and organization. | Reign of Charles I Stuart |

At this point, the nation undergoes a phenomenon known as the "national revolution": the sovereign is disqualified and eliminated during major civil unrest. The smaller elites organize into a representative body that takes control of the kingdom, unleashing energies previously repressed by the late Ancien Régime.

| Date | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| t+600 | During the unrest, a military dictator takes control of the country, capitalizing on the population's resentment from the previous regime's defeats in its final years. The dictator mobilizes the new resources of the fresh elite and enters a brief phase of large military campaigns against neighboring states, resulting in a final defeat. This defeat paves the way for a more stable regime controlled by the parliament, representing the newly and relatively broadly recruited elite. This parliamentary regime evolves into a complete democracy by gradually expanding electoral participation and integrating new social classes into the civic body. | The English Civil War begins in 1642 and lasts until 1651. After the parliamentary forces, led by Oliver Cromwell, emerge victorious, England enters a period of political upheaval. Cromwell establishes the Commonwealth of England and assumes dictatorial powers as Lord Protector. After Cromwell's death in 1658, political instability continues. Eventually, in 1660, the monarchy is restored, marking the end of the English Commonwealth. Charles II, the son of the executed King Charles I, returns from exile and is welcomed as king. However, the monarchy is restored as a constitutional monarchy, meaning the monarch's powers are limited by Parliament's authority. |

This course represents an "ideal" trajectory where major disruptions do not hinder the social evolution of the confederation, or what we now call a nation-state. It cannot progress much faster because it is closely tied to human cognitive constants and the pace at which a society evolves and achieves large-scale cultural homogenization. However, it can slow down, stop entirely, derail, or even restart.

#### The "Oligarchic Republic"

A type of disruption occurs when the oligarchs manage to prevail in their struggle against the sovereign. This can happen at any point in the process, but it is more likely to occur when the sovereign is weak, such as at the beginning, during civil wars, or during a successful "Fronde" in the early stages of "absolute sovereignty." External invasions or disruptions can also weaken the sovereign to the point where the oligarchs regain control.

A defeat of the sovereign by their oligarchs leads to the establishment of an "oligarchic republic." In this type of regime, the oligarchs set up a system characterized by decentralization among themselves and multiple checks and balances on executive powers to prevent the emergence of a new sovereign.

Oligarchic republics can generally last as a regime for a century or two until a new "sovereign" finally emerges, despite all the regime's political mechanisms. This emergence becomes necessary due to the need for centralized authority to lead the country in times of war. This new centralized authority can bring the country either back to the initial stage of the whole "nation-state" process or to the "absolutist" phase after civil wars, depending on the society's level of cultural evolution.

An important historical example of an oligarchic republic is the United Provinces of the Netherlands. During the Eighty Years' War in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch provinces successfully revolted against their sovereign, the Habsburg Emperor, leading to the rise of Dutch oligarchs who took control of the country and established an oligarchic republic.

Over the years, the position of the Stadtholder, who served as the military leader of the Republic, gradually grew in influence and authority. This increase in power eventually transformed the Stadtholder's position into absolute power by the 18th century. However, this concentration of power ultimately led to dissatisfaction and resistance within the Netherlands.

In 1785, a national revolution took place in the United Provinces, leading to massive political changes.
